Data Visualization Final Project on Graffiti and Crime
By David Colonia, David Cruz, Lauren Calso, and Phil Sohn

Title: Wrong Side of the Tracks

Topic: Give context surrounding the culture of graffiti. How it has affected the culture of the Bay Area and evolved into a legitimate art form (HTML) with additional insights into its criminal aspects (regression)

Rationale: This project has a lot of anthropology behind it. The data here is largely qualitative and the goal of the project is to communicate a non-technical research assignment into a technical framework. This is done by combining web scraping and visualization with data analysis (SK Learn) to provide an ethnographic representation of the graffiti culture.

Problem: Using the metric of overall crime figures, we can see what the affect of crime is property values to determine economic effect crime can have on neighborhoods. Originally we aimed to incubate the effect graffiti had on these prices to determine if the money spent on policing can be justified. If property crime figures show to have a sizable impact on property values. Can these figures be attributed to graffiti?

Why: Graffiti is a crime or performance art depending on who is asked. The point of our html is to categorize and illustrate the nuances of graffiti culture. The images were scraped from the web to add a technical aspect to this arm of our project. In a lot of ways the manner of characterizing our html (styles, crews, notable taggers) mimic the ways that police track graffiti. 


Our regression used crime stats from 50 towns alongside median property values and regressed property price on crime figures.
